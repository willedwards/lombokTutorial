# lombokTutorial

This tutortial shows how some standard code can be simplified and compacted through use of the lombok dependency.

The code before lombok is applied lives on the *standard* branch.

The code after lombok is applied lives on the *complete* branch. This will allow you to compare the same equivalent code bases.

There is a bunch of unit tests around the code to give a degree of confidence that the refactor is correct.
