# lombokTutorial

This tutortial shows how some standard code can be simplified and compacted through use of the lombok dependency.

## Pre-requisites
a) Install jdk 1.8, so that
```
>java -version 
java version "1.8.0_161"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_161-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.161-b12, mixed mode)

b) Install intellij ultimate (download free 30 day trial)

c) Install maven 3.5.2
so that

```
>mvn -version
```

gives 3.5.2

### 



The code before lombok is applied lives on the *standard* branch.

The code after lombok is applied lives on the *complete* branch. This will allow you to compare the same equivalent code bases.

There is a bunch of unit tests around the code to give a degree of confidence that the refactor is correct.
